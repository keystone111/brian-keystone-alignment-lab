Brian Keystone Alignment Lab
Exploring incentive alignment, governance robustness, and AI-assisted decision-making in decentralized systems.
Overview
Brian Keystone Alignment Lab is an experimental research project investigating how economic incentives, governance mechanisms, and AI-assisted tools interact in open, adversarial environments such as blockchains and decentralized platforms.
While the project is blockchain-native, its primary focus is on alignment problems that also appear in modern AI systems: reward design, emergent behavior, robustness under manipulation, and human–AI collaboration.
This repository documents ongoing experiments, simulations, and design notes rather than a finished production system.
Motivation
Decentralized systems and advanced AI share a common challenge:
How do we design systems where optimized behavior remains aligned with long-term human goals?
Incentive misalignment in blockchains (short-term farming, governance capture, adversarial coordination) mirrors reward hacking and misalignment in reinforcement learning. This project treats blockchain mechanisms as a sandbox for studying alignment dynamics.
Research Questions
How do different staking reward curves influence long-term participation?
What penalty structures discourage short-term exploitation without reducing adoption?
Can AI-assisted proposal analysis improve governance outcomes without centralizing power?
How does emergent behavior change as incentive parameters are adjusted?
Project Components
Incentive & Staking Simulations
Simple simulations to explore how agents respond to reward curves, lock-up periods, and penalties under varying assumptions.
AI-Assisted Governance Tools
Early prototypes for:
Proposal summarization and risk flagging
Trend detection across governance activity
Human-in-the-loop decision support (AI suggests, humans decide)
Design Documentation
Extensive notes on tokenomics, governance trade-offs, adversarial scenarios, and alignment parallels between blockchain and AI systems.
Current Status
This project is intentionally exploratory. Code may be incomplete, refactored frequently, or replaced as insights evolve. Emphasis is placed on clear reasoning, documented failures, and iteration rather than polish.
Future Directions
Multi-agent simulations with strategic behavior
Formalizing reward modeling experiments
Deeper exploration of AI-assisted governance alignment
Bridging insights to reinforcement learning and alignment research
